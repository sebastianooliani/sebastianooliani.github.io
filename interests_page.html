    <p>Besides my studies, in my free-time I love <strong>listening and playing music, reading <a href="fav_books.html">books</a> or doing outdoor activities</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have been playing <strong>football</strong> for many years, especially during high school. Now, I am playing it less often, but I still enjoy it.
    Right now, during my weeks I like <strong>riding my bike and swimming</strong>, which I find more relaxing and less stressful. I also enjoy hiking in the mountains, but I have not done it too much.
    <br>
    <br>
    During high school, I played <strong>electric guitar and bass guitar</strong>. I took lectures of both of them until when I moved to Bologna for my bachelor.
    I have played in several small concerts and I also recorded two songs (<i>Sweet Dreams</i> by the Eurythmics and <i>Chandelier</i> by Sia) in a studio together with a modern music orchestra. 
    I recorded the guitar parts for both songs. Unfortunately, I cannot find these recordings anymore, but they are definitely somewhere online.

    Although it might sound strange, I do not have a favourite music genre, but I listen to a lot of different things, either old or new. 
    I grow up listening mostly to rock music, and that's why I love to play the guitar and the bass, but
    I am actually listening to very different things. From hard rock to slow ballads, from jazz to rap, and from rap to disco music. 
    I love to discover new music and artists. You can read the list of my <a href="fav_albums.html">favourite albums</a> I have listen to.
