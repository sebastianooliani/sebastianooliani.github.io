    <h2 class="section-title">Favourite Books</h2>
    Here are some of my favourite books. I have read more than 50 books just in the last 5 years. These can be considered as the ones which left a mark on me.
    I have read them in different periods of my life. For example, I read Odyssey and watched the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(1968_miniseries)" target="_blank">entire series from Franco Rossi</a> when I was 12.
    <br>
    I mostly read in Italian and do not have a favourite genre. I listed the english title next to the italian one, but I read all the following in Italian.
    I know that I should read more in English (since it is the language I use most of my days), but I find it easier and more relaxing to read in my native language.
    <br>
    I read on average more than 10 books per year. I would like to read more, but I have many other things to do too :(.
    <br> Nevertheless, I am satisfied with my reading habits.
