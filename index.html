            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small village in the North of <strong>Italy</strong> 
                (very very small, check <a href="https://www.google.it/maps/place/46020+Carbonara+di+Po+MN/@45.0335496,11.218208,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x477fa06daa459b2d:0x6ec924954b4ade25!8m2!3d45.0377186!4d11.226505!16zL20vMGdqX3I3?hl=it&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyMy4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNjQwSAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>), 
                where I have been living until 19. 
            Then, I moved to Bologna, where I spent the three years of my Bachelor's.
            Finally, in September 2022 I left my homecountry and started a Master's Degree at ETH Z&uuml;rich.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a hard-working and passionate individual with a strong background in engineering.
            I am particularly captivated by <strong>robotics, artificial intelligence, and control systems.</strong>
            Even though it is not my cup of tea, I try following the phylosofical and political discussions around aspects and consequences of AI and robotics.
            My interests are as spread as the field of robotics itself, going from hardware design and manufacturing to control and AI.
            I have mostly worked on <strong>robotic manipulation</strong>, first using a dexterous robotic hand, and then using a dual-arm setup. 
            <br>
            <br> I have completed a six month internship at Hitachi Energy as a <strong>Data Engineer</strong>, which
            I found very interesting, educational and stimulating.
            <br> 
            <br>My mother tongue is Italian, but I speak fluently English <i>und ein bisschen Deutsch</i>.

            <h2 class="section-title">Interests</h2>
            <p>Besides my studies, in my free-time I love <strong>listening and playing music, reading books (<a href="fav_books.html">here</a> is a list of my favourites) or doing outdoor activities</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been playing <strong>football</strong> for many years, especially during high school. Now, I am playing it less often, but I still enjoy it.
            Right now, during my weeks I like <strong>riding my bike and swimming</strong>, which I find more relaxing and less stressful. I also enjoy hiking in the mountains, but I have not done it too much.
            <br>
            <br>
            During high school, I played <strong>electric guitar and bass guitar</strong>. I took lectures of both of them until when I moved to Bologna for my bachelor.
            I have played in several small concerts and I also recorded two songs (<i>Sweet Dreams</i> by the Eurythmics and <i>Chandelier</i> by Sia) in a studio together with a modern music orchestra. 
            I recorded the guitar parts for both songs. Unfortunately, I cannot find these recordings anymore, but they are definitely somewhere online.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although it might sound strange, I do not have a favourite music genre, but I listen to a lot of different things, either old or new. 
            I grow up listening mostly to rock music, and that's why I love to play the guitar and the bass, but
            I am actually listening to very different things. From hard rock to slow ballads, from jazz to rap, and from rap to disco music. 
            I love to discover new music and artists. You can read the list of my <a href="fav_albums.html">favourite albums</a> I have listen to.
