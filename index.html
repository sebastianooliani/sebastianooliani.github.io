            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small village in the North of <strong>Italy</strong> 
                (very very small, check <a href="https://www.google.it/maps/place/46020+Carbonara+di+Po+MN/@45.0335496,11.218208,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x477fa06daa459b2d:0x6ec924954b4ade25!8m2!3d45.0377186!4d11.226505!16zL20vMGdqX3I3?hl=it&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyMy4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNjQwSAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>), 
                where I have been living until 19. 
            Then, I moved to Bologna, where I spent the three years of my Bachelor's.
            Finally, in September 2022 I left my homecountry and started a Master's Degree at ETH Z&uuml;rich.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a hard-working and passionate individual with a strong background in engineering.
            I am particularly captivated by <strong>robotics, artificial intelligence, and control systems.</strong>
            Even though it is not my cup of tea, I try following the phylosofical and political discussions around aspects and consequences of AI and robotics.
            My interests are as spread as the field of robotics itself, going from hardware design and manufacturing to control and AI.
            I have mostly worked on <strong>robotic manipulation</strong>, first using a dexterous robotic hand, and then using a dual-arm setup.
            After my Master's, I started working at <a href"https://www.embotech.com/" target="_blank">Embotech</a> a Swiss-based tech startup developing products for Autonomous Driving systems. 
            <br>
            <br> I have also completed a six month internship at Hitachi Energy working as a <strong>Data Engineer</strong>. I found the role very interesting, educational and stimulating.
            <br> 
            <br>My mother tongue is Italian, but I speak fluently English <i>und ein bisschen Deutsch</i>.
            <br> 
            <br>In my free time, I enjoy reading books on a variety of topics, from thriller to science fiction, riding my bike, swimming, and playing music.
            During my Master's, I organized monthly social events for <a href="https://www.sis-zh.com/" target="_blank">"Swiss Italian Society - Zurigo"</a>, the ETH Italian Student Association.
