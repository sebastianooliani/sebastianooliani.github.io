            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small village in the North of Italy, where I have been living until 19. 
            Then, I moved to Bologna, where I spent the three years of my Bachelor's.
            Finally, in September 2022 I left my homecountry and started a Master's Degree at ETH Z&uuml;rich.
            I am a hard-working and passionate individual with a strong background in engineering.
            My interests are as spread as the field of robotics itself, going from hardware design and manufacturing to control and AI.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Interests</h2>
            <p>Besides my studies, in my free-time I love listening and playing music, reading books or doing outdoor activities.
            Although it might sound strange, I do not have a favourite music genre, but I listen to a lot of different things, either old or new. 
            I grow up listening mostly to rock music, and that's why I love to play the guitar and the bass, but
            I am actually listening to a lot of different genres. From hard rock to slow ballads, from jazz to rap, and from rap to disco music. 
            I love to discover new music and artists.
